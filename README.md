# Data Science Machine Learning-Notebook
A Jupyter Notebook with an exemplary workflow on data preparation and model creation in *scikit-learn*. For demonstration, the model is based on the Boston Housing Dataset, which is imported via the *scikit-learn* dataset repository.

Contains the following steps:
- data exploration (show data distribution, correlations, and issues with invalid values)
- model creation and fitting for two different models (K-nearest Neighbors Regressor and Random Forest Regressor)
- rating of Feature Importances based on the Random Forest Regressor model
- template to use the model for actual predictions
